# SQS Customers Service

This repository contains the implementation of an AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS) based application that handles customer data. It is divided into two main components:

1. **Customers.Api**: This is the main API that handles customer related requests.

2. **Customers.Consumer**: This component consumes messages from the queue.

This project is an excellent example of a distributed system that uses AWS SQS for handling asynchronous messaging between components.
